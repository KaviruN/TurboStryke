# TurboStryke

Welcome to TurboStryke!

## What is this?
This project was created for my university assignment. It's a React + Vite app where speed and style collideâ€”well, mostly speed. Because who has time for anything else in university, right?

## Why only one CSS file?
You might notice there's just a single, glorious CSS file in this whole project. No SASS, no LESS, no Tailwind, not even sneaky inline styles. Why? Well... the truth is, I'm a bit lazy ðŸ™ƒ. Setting up SASS felt like too much work for my tired, student brain. So, I shoved all the styles into one place and called it a day. If you like chaos, youâ€™ll love this.

## Features
- Built with React and Vite (for maximum velocity)
- JavaScript all the way
- All styles in one CSS file for peak laziness efficiency

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Enjoy the app (and the wild ride in the single CSS file)

## Final Words
If my professor is reading this: I swear Iâ€™ll use SASS next time. Maybe. Probably. Okay, no promises.

Made with ðŸ’», â˜•, and pure laziness.

> Just a heads up: at my uni, we only learn basic HTML and CSS for nowâ€”I'm still in the foundation stage.
