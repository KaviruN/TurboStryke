# 🚗 TurboStryke

> **Fun fact:** I actually tried **Three.js** for the first time in this project and even focused hard enough to make a custom **404 page**!  
But don’t expect to see Three.js magic in my other projects—I’m way too lazy for that kind of consistency.  
This was a one-time burst of motivation. 😅


## 🏁 Welcome to TurboStryke!

TurboStryke is a car-themed web app where speed meets style—well, mostly speed.  
Built for a university assignment, it’s a React + Vite project with a touch of chaos and a single CSS file holding it all together.

## 🎨 Design & Theme

The site’s look and feel are inspired by the Akatsuki clan from Naruto — think black and red, mysterious and bold.
Because why settle for boring when you can have villain chic?

## 🏎️ A Note on the 3D Model

Yes, I know the **LaFerrari** 3D model doesn’t exactly *fit* the project.  
It’s a hypercar, not a tuning-friendly street machine.  
But hey—**LaFerrari is my favorite car**, and this is *my* project. So guess what? It’s staying.  

Also, as a die-hard **F1 fan**, I couldn’t resist sneaking in some Ferrari love.  
**But don’t worry**—I didn’t theme it after the **2025 Ferrari F1 car (SF-25)** because let’s be honest...  
that thing is **so slow**, it would've made this site load in reverse. 🐌💨

## 📦 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React  
- ⚡ Vite  
- 🟨 JavaScript  
- 🌐 Three.js (for that one scene I poured my soul into)  
- 🎨 One glorious, all-powerful CSS file

## 🧐 Why Only One CSS File?

You might notice there's just a single, beautiful, overloaded CSS file in this whole project.  
No SASS, no LESS, no Tailwind—not even cheeky inline styles.

**Why?**  
Because setting up a CSS framework takes time, brain cells, and organization.  
And I have none of those during exam season 🙃

If you thrive in chaos, you’ll feel right at home.

## 🚀 Features

- Built with **React** and **Vite** (for maximum velocity)  
- Self-inflicted CSS spaghetti  
- 3D-powered **404 page** using **Three.js**

- No UI libraries. No component libraries. Just raw hustle and vibes

## 📚 Just a Heads Up

At my university, we’ve only learned basic HTML and CSS so far—I'm still in the foundation stage.  
So everything else in this project?  
That’s pure self-study, late-night YouTube dives, broken VS Code themes, and a lot of *"why isn't this working"* moments. ☕💻

## 🎤 Final Words

If my professor is reading this:  
Yes, I know this isn’t “industry standard.”  
Yes, I will use SASS next time.  
Okay fine… *eventually*. No promises. 😅
