# TurboStryke

Welcome to TurboStryke!

## What is this?
This project was created for my university assignment. It's a React + Vite app where speed and style collideâ€”well, mostly speed. Because who has time for anything else in university, right?

## Why only one CSS file?
You might notice there's just a single, glorious CSS file in this whole project. No SASS, no LESS, no Tailwind, not even sneaky inline styles. Why? Well... the truth is, I'm a bit lazy ðŸ™ƒ. Setting up SASS felt like too much work for my tired, student brain. So, I shoved all the styles into one place and called it a day. If you like chaos, youâ€™ll love this.

## Features
- Built with React and Vite (for maximum velocity)
- JavaScript all the way
- All styles in one CSS file for peak laziness efficiency

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Enjoy the app (and the wild ride in the single CSS file)

## Foundation Level? You're in the Right Place!
Are you in the foundation stage and only know the magic words `<div>` and `background-color`? Perfect! This project is totally just basic HTML and CSS. Ignore all that React, Vite, Three.js, and router stuffâ€”that's just... uh... really fancy HTML comments, yeah! 

If you're starting out, all you need to understand this project is:
- How to write `<h1>Hello World</h1>` 
- The ancient art of `margin: 0 auto`
- Maybe some `display: flex` if you're feeling adventurous

All that JavaScript magic? That's for the next level! Here, we keep it simple with just the basics. The fact that there are 638 modules transforming during build? Don't worry about thatâ€”it's just... really, really basic CSS. Trust me. ðŸ™ƒ

## Final Words
If my professor is reading this: I swear Iâ€™ll use SASS next time. Maybe. Probably. Okay, no promises.

Made with ðŸ’», â˜•, and pure laziness.
